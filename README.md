# Social-network-analyst

This project utilizes `pathlib`, `networkx`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to conduct a comprehensive social network analysis. The analysis involves exploring various network metrics, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. By leveraging these metrics, we gain insights into social dynamics, including popularity, influence, and the role of individuals within a group.

The study aims to understand how network structures can provide valuable information about social interactions. By analyzing the relationships between individuals in a network, we gain a deeper understanding of the connections and influences that shape the group's dynamics.

One significant aspect of the analysis involves applying multi-linear regression. By studying the relationship between student attendance, gender, and various network centrality measures, we can identify statistically significant connections. This provides valuable insights into the social interaction dynamics within the student group, shedding light on how attendance, gender, and network centrality are interrelated.

Overall, this social network analysis offers valuable information about the underlying social dynamics, providing researchers and analysts with a deeper understanding of social structures, relationships, and influences within the studied group.
